This page is built with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev), a framework for building [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. Read more about Sapper and get started [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template).

The [index.html](index.html) and [404.html](404.html) files are temporary and do not belong to the Sapper app. They are currently what GitHub recognizes, and should be taken down once I figure out how to generate static files from Sapper and host them here.
